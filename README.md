**Steps for Circuit Design and Verification**
1. Open https://www.edaplayground.com/ in the browser.
2. Click on Testbench+Design placed on the top left side and select VHDL.
3. Then type your simulation entity in the Top entity.
4. From Tools & Simulators select "Cadence Xcelium 20.09".
5. Then, in Run options select "Open EPwave after run".
6. Write your code in testbench.vhd and design.vhd file.
7. Finally, click on "Run" placed at the top.
8. View the waveform in the waveform viewer that is adjacent to the EDA playground tab.
